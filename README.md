### **Project Description: Parking Lot Space and Area Monitoring System**

This project focuses on developing a computer vision-based system to monitor and analyze parking lots using a combination of image processing and machine learning techniques. The system is designed to detect available parking spaces, calculate the total parking area, and provide real-time visual feedback to users. It offers an efficient and scalable solution for parking lot management and optimization.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Parking Space Detection:**
   - The system uses static images or video feeds to identify parking slots.
   - Free and occupied spaces are detected by analyzing pixel intensity and density in pre-defined parking regions.

2. **Interactive Spot Management:**
   - Users can add or remove parking spots interactively using mouse clicks.
   - Left-click to add a new parking slot and right-click to remove an existing one.

3. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - Continuously monitors the parking area and updates the status of each slot (free or occupied).
   - Displays the total number of free and occupied slots.

4. **Total Parking Area Calculation:**
   - Computes the total parking area based on the dimensions of each slot (16x8 feet, resulting in 128 square feet per slot).
   - Displays the total area in square feet on the screen for easy reference.

5. **User-Friendly Visualization:**
   - Draws color-coded rectangles around parking spots:
     - Green for free spots.
     - Red for occupied spots.
   - Overlay of real-time data, such as free slots and total parking area, directly on the image.

6. **Customizable for Different Parking Lots:**
   - The system allows dynamic addition and modification of parking slots to adapt to various layouts.

### **Technologies Used:**

- **OpenCV:** For image processing tasks such as thresholding, blurring, and dilation.
- **NumPy:** For efficient matrix operations.
- **cvzone:** For easy overlay of text and shapes on images.
- **Pickle:** For saving and loading parking lot configurations.

### **Workflow:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Load an image of the parking lot.
   - Pre-load saved parking positions from a file or define them interactively.

2. **Image Preprocessing:**
   - Convert the image to grayscale.
   - Apply Gaussian blur, adaptive thresholding, and dilation to enhance features for slot detection.

3. **Slot Analysis:**
   - For each defined slot, crop the corresponding region and count non-black pixels to determine occupancy.
   - Update slot status (free or occupied) and display it visually.

4. **Area Calculation:**
   - Compute the total parking area based on the number of slots and their predefined dimensions.
   - Display the total area on the image for reference.

5. **Interactive Configuration:**
   - Add or remove slots dynamically using mouse clicks.
   - Save updated configurations for future use.

### **Applications:**

- **Commercial Parking Lots:** Efficiently manage large parking areas by tracking available spaces.
- **Smart Cities:** Integrate the system with IoT for smart parking solutions.
- **Shopping Malls and Offices:** Provide real-time parking availability to visitors.
- **Event Venues:** Dynamically allocate and monitor parking spaces during events.
